        // Double equal == perform type coercion and it is also called loose equality operator.
        // Example

        const age = "18";

        // Here a string 18 is compared to the number 18 and string and number is not equal whether they are same , but when compared ,it show true result and it means that double equal perform type coercion where a string is changed into number by JS itself  and comapred to the given condition.

        if (age == 18) console.log(`You are ${age} years old`);
        else console.log(`You are less than ${age} years old`);

        // Ttiple equal ==== doesn't perform type coercion and it is also called strict equality operator.
        // Triple equalto checks the datatype , value and when identical then  produce true result whereas double equalto checks only value not datatype
        // Example

        const height = 18;
        if (height === 18)
            console.log(`You are ${height} years old, congrats dude`);
        else
            console.log(
                `You are still a kid and you are below ${height} years old`

        let firstName = prompt("What's your first name");
        if (firstName) console.log(`Hey ${firstName} , how are you !`);
        else console.log(`You dont input any name?`);
